VillagerShops
=====

Description:
-----

This plugin allows you to set up villagers or other mobs as shops.  
They will sell items as **admin shop** (this means infinite stock), or as **player shops** if placed above a chest.  
The shop will be displayed as inventory over multiple pages you can modify with chat commands as admin or if you own the shop.  
Buy items with a primary click and sell them with a secondary click (usually primary is the left mouse button).  
You can also name the shop mobs and set the variant (Villager profession).  
Additionally you can set items to ignore damage, nbt or use oredict entries.  
*Please note that your server needs any economy Plugin for this to work*
